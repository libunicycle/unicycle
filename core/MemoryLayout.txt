Memory layout:

 * headers (like multiboot)
 * text - executables
 * destructors - list of functions to call when the app goes down
 * ro - readonly data
 * data - read/write data
 * init - section (text/ro/data) unloaded from the memory after init complete
 * constructors - pointers to initialization functions

 * HEAP - phisical contingent memory available to app

 * per_cpu - each cpu gets a slice of this area. And each slice is divided to [data/bss/stack]
